# LechugaELP’s Sapiens panel theme (for Xfce4)
## What is the Sapiens theme?

- The Sapiens theme intends to replicate the feel of 2000s’ aesthetics, some may know it as “Skeumorphic design” while other know it as “Frutiger Aero”. Deep down, we all know what it is.   
- While this is heavily inspired on old Ubuntu’s design, it also includes the side dock, from more modern versions, to keep the functionality of a modern desktop environment. 

### What is included in the Sapiens theme?

- The theme includes textures different textures for the top panel and the side dock (or “launcher”) These textures are:   
  - Glossy (Ubuntu orange lighting)  
  - Glossy (Green lighting for SUSE or Mint)  
  - Glossy (Grayscale for generic use)  
  - Plastic  
- The theme also includes the textures for the whiskermenu button, with theming for a bunch of different distros:   
  - Ubuntu  
  - Ubuntu (Alternative)  
  - Debian  
  - Arch  
  - Arch (old)  
  - Fedora  
  - Mint  
  - SUSE

## Installation: 

The installation process is simple, you must: 

- Put the `Sapiens` folder into `$Home/.themes/`
- Import the `Sapiens.tar.bz2` file to your panel profiles, through the Settings Manager. 
- You can customize the textures by right clicking the panels/button and going to their properties, or through `Panel`, in the Settings Manager. 
- Could this be done in a better way? Maybe, but I don't really have a lot of technical knowledge so this is the best I can do. 

## Will this be updated in the future? 

- Maybe, I may add some more distros and panel textures in the future, no promises, though. 

## Why no wallpapers?

- The wallpapers from the screenshots are just copy-pastes from the distros' official repos, or they were made by an artist on another site. I specifically made the Arch one with a generic wallpaper because I couldn't find a convincing one. I don't feel comfortable sharing them here, even if some of them are technically free to redistribute, I think it would be appropriating the authorship. If you want any specific wallpaper, you can DM me and I will send it to you, or at least point out the source.
